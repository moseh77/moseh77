# Interests

The Particular fields of tech I'm interested in are as follows

## 1. CyberSecurity 

Here's a rephrased version:

What first sparked my interest in tech was stumbling across YouTube videos of security professionals doing fascinating things with the browser and the Kali Linux command line. I didnâ€™t fully understand what they were doing at the time, but I knew I wanted to learn and be able to do the same.

## 3. Cloud Technologies 
My interest in cloud technologies led me to enroll in the AWS re/Start program from May to August 2024, where I became an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and earned an AWS re/Start badge. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and take my skills to the next level!

## I am familiar with the following AWS tools just to highlight a few.

![AmazonVPC](./amazonvpc.jpeg) &nbsp; `AmazonVPC`  
Amazon VPC lets you create a private, isolated network within AWS, giving you control over IP addresses, subnets, and security settings to securely deploy resources.

![AmazonCloudFront](./cloudfront.jpeg) &nbsp; `AmazonCloudFront`  
Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs with low latency and high transfer speeds.

![AmazonCloudFormation](./cloudformation.jpeg) &nbsp; `AmazonCloudFormation`  
Amazon CloudFormation automates the setup and deployment of AWS resources using templates, allowing you to model and manage your infrastructure as code.

![AmazonEC2](./ec2.jpeg) &nbsp; `AmazonEC2`  
Amazon EC2 provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud, allowing you to quickly launch, configure, and manage compute resources for various applications.
