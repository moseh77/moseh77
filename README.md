# 👋 Hi, I’m Moses Njuguna

I’m a **Cybersecurity & Cloud Engineering practitioner** focused on **offensive security, defensive monitoring, cloud infrastructure, and automation**.  
My work centers on understanding **how systems fail, how attacks unfold, and how to design resilient, automated, and secure architectures**.

I operate at the intersection of **security engineering, cloud platforms, and AI-driven automation**, with hands-on experience from labs, CTFs, real-world simulations, and production-style environments.
