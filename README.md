# 👋 Hi, I’m Moses Njuguna

I’m a **Cybersecurity & Cloud Engineering practitioner** focused on **offensive security, defensive monitoring, cloud infrastructure, backend development, and AI-powered automation**.  
My work centers on understanding **how systems fail, how attacks unfold, and how to design resilient, automated, and secure architectures**.

I operate at the intersection of **security engineering, cloud platforms, backend/full-stack development, and AI-driven automation**, with hands-on experience across labs, CTFs, cloud environments, and production-style systems.
